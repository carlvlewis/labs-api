Users can select from a list of projects sorted by the most recent milestone date and an interactive map allows users to find projects of interest based on location. Users can filter projects by date, community district, project stage, project applicant, project description, project name, flood zone, and much more. Each project’s individual page provides a map of the BBLs associated with the project along with a collection of project information like a project’s important milestones and associated zoning actions. Users can also find links to City Planning Commission reports and can access a project’s BBLs in ZOLA, BISWeb, and ACRIS.\n\nZAP Search allows planners, city officials, and residents to better understand past land use changes and remain up to date on projects that are currently under review in their neighborhoods.","tagline":"A tool for quickly finding past and present land use applications","url":"https://zap.planning.nyc.gov/projects","github":"https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-zap-search","type":"feature","customer":"Business Improvement Division"},"createdTime":"2018-04-20T20:05:31.000Z"},{"id":"recedpZZ5fDbZ9skF","fields":{"name":"NYC Street Map","thumbnail":[{"id":"attgGcs4uJZEIWNVy","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/ZdgIo23vT1CwEGEt1RXC_dcp-nyc-street-map.jpg","filename":"dcp-nyc-street-map.jpg","size":93547,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/H4BvKNEhQzmHQJYv3QiP_small_dcp-nyc-street-map.jpg","width":56,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/cDYOONnfSDuBPZYD0cvL_large_dcp-nyc-street-map.jpg","width":800,"height":511},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/OjNX2hYRoa6k9D09qdSs_full_dcp-nyc-street-map.jpg","width":800,"height":511}}}],"description":"NYC Street Map is an ongoing effort to digitize official street records, bring them together with other street information, and make them easily accessible to the public.

Data for user-defined areas can be easily contrasted against New York City, City boroughs, City Community Districts (approximate equivalents are used), and City neighborhoods (Neighborhood Tabulation Areas). Along with count statistics (like total Spanish-speaking population), users are provided with percent values (like percent of the population with a bachelor’s degree or higher), arithmetic means (like mean travel time to work), rates (like rental housing vacancy rate), and medians (like median household income). NYC PFF profiles can also show how a selected area has changed over time. Further, each profile contains charts allowing users to visualize the distribution of selected statistics, comparing user-defined study areas with a contrast area. All NYC PFF estimates are evaluated for data reliability – unreliable data are grayed out, alerting users of unsuitability for general use.
